This recording is commonly obtained using a modern FDA-cleared recording device, such as the <i>Fitbit Sense™ </i>health watch, <i>Samsung Galaxy™ </i>watch, or <i>KardiaMobile™ </i>device. The interpretation is provided by a Board-Certified Cardiologist. The interpretation is intended to occur expeditiously and inexpensively.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: left;">The electrocardiographic recording (ECG) that is obtained with a mobile device is a remarkably easy and convenient measurement of ongoing heart activity. It is highly informative in most instances.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: left;">It is our opinion that the information provided by the recording can be further enhanced by the prompt oversight of a medical specialist who is highly trained in electrocardiographic analysis.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">R3 is not a substitute for appropriate in-person or Telehealth care by a physician.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: left;">The information obtained from the ECG recording obtained from a wrist wearable device mimics one of the 12 leads—lead I— that is commonly obtained in a physician’s oﬃce. The classic 12 lead electrocardiogram provides substantially more information about the heart than does a single lead recording.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: left;">Nevertheless, as an instantly accessible method of assessing a heart rhythm at the time of the user’s choosing, the ECG from a wrist wearable device is unsurpassed. With R3, we hope to help maximize its performance and thereby further enhance its utility.</p></body></html>
